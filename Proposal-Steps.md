#Proposals

Proposals are used to make official decisions within the Volatility Protocol DAO. Creating a proposal is an iterative process that goes from Idea -> Proposal -> Community Call -> Implementation. This is a transparent and open process that gives clear information to all community members and allows for all community member to give inputs.

#From Idea to Implementation

In order for a proposal to be successfully implemented it needs to move through the following steps.

##Step 1 - Idea

Anyone can publicly post an idea that they have for a proposal on the [Volatilty Protocol Forum](forum.volatilty.com).This could be changes to rewards, a volatility methodology, or etc. The purpose of an idea is to elicit lots of feedback. Therefore, itâ€™s good practice to do the following:

1. Tag your post with [IDEA]. Both in the title and with the tag.
2. Give your post the appropriate categories (e.g. Governance DAO or Governance PIP).
3. Describe your idea in the text of the post.
4. Ask questions that you need to turn your idea into a draft proposal. 

There is no time requirement for how long an idea is in the forum before posting it as a proposal but it is best practice to get feedback on your idea.
